## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities via [Telegram](https://t.me/AravindVNair99) with PoCs.
- Make sure to provide as much details as possible when reporting.
- You will receive a response from me within 12 hours.
- If the issue is confirmed, I will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.

**Note:** Minor non-sensitive vulnerabilities can be reported in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/aravindvnair99/Spot-the-Hole/issues) itself instead of Telegram.
